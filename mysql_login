first , you should change /etc/mysql/my.cnf 
bind-address = 127.0.0.1 
to
# bind-address = 127.0.0.1
then restart your mysql service.



login in mysql by root
#mysql -u root -p

mysql>grant all on *.* to root@'%' identified by 'pass';

mysql>flush privileges;

then you can login mysql in other computer by root route.


if you want create a new database , and create a new user for it
you can do like this:

#mysql -u root -p

mysql>create database test DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

mysql>use test;

mysql>grant all privileges on test.* to user1@'%' identified by 'pass1' with grant option;

mysql>flush privileges;
